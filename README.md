# Employee Managment System MYSQL

This program helps manage multiple employees, jobs, managers, salaries, and much more!

## Installation

To install, run npm install, then login to mysql, run SOURCE db/schema.sql, then SOURCE db/seeds.sql

## Usage

to use, you will need to run your sources, simply log into mysql, run SOURCE db/schema.sql then SOURCE db/seeds.sql to populate your existing jobs and employees. Then by running node server.js, you will be able to add an employee, make changes to an existing employee, create a new job, create a new department, and view all your changes in a templated table!

## Test

To Test it, simply install the required apps (npm install) then run your mysql files (log into mysql (mysql -u root), run SOURCE db/schema.sql, then SOURCE db/seeds.sql. Remember to quit out of MYSQL) then input node server.js into your terminal. You will have full access to the employee database from there!
